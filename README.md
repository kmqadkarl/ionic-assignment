#Mobile development project on Calorie Counter
by Karl McDonnell - G00305460

The app is covered in Github @ https://github.com/kmqadkarl/ionic-assignment

The app is divided into three main parts

1 - Breakfast
2 - Lunch
3 - Dinner

In each page there is a sample amount of foods that add up on each page. There is a max calorie count of 2000 and after that an alert box appears telling you to go for a cycle. You have eaten too much.

There is a menu bar plus some tabs at the bottom linking to other pages.

What i used to develop the app was mainly what we were shown in class.
