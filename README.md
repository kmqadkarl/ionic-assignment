#Mobile development project on Calorie Counter
by Karl McDonnell - G00305460

The app is covered in Github @

			#https://github.com/kmqadkarl/ionic-assignment

The app is divided into four main parts

1 - Breakfast
2 - Lunch
3 - Dinner
4 - New Food Item

In each page there is a sample amount of foods that add up on each page. There is a max calorie count of 2000 and after that an alert box appears telling you to go for a cycle. You have eaten too much.

I used the todoProject to add foods and put in the localstorage to keep new Food Items custom inserted. See add.html and app.js.

There is a menu bar plus some tabs at the bottom linking to other pages.

What I used to develop the app was mainly what we were shown in class.

See all the comments in the files to see.
